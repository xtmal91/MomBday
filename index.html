	<p class="paragraph1"> Now I know how much you love penguins. So I thought I would piece together a video for you. I made the entire video below from scratch. I found the footage online, clipped it all together, added the captions and trasitions, everything. This is part of the reason it took me longer than I thought. I hope you enjoy it and find it funny!</p>

	<p class="endWords">I really hope you like what I have built for you. It took me a decent amount of hours to put it all together. Not only did I get to make something cool for you, but I also finally found a meaningful project I could build with a final goal in mind, using my new skills. Like I said before, I had fun doing all this and learned a lot. Plus I got to go over some of the coding I learned in the early stages of my course, which will only make me a better web developer.</p>
	<p class="endWords"> I made this web page "responsive", which means it should be able to load up and look good on any device (phone, tablet, computer) so now you can pull it up on your phone and say, "look what my son made for me"! </p>
	<p class="endWords">As I learn more and more cool things as a web developer I will continue to add more to this in the future.</p>
	<p class="endWords">Once again, HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM!!!</p>
	<p class="endWords">I love you so much!</p>
